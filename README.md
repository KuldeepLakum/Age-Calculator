🛠️ Technologies Used

The Age Calculator uses JavaScript to perform precise date calculations. Here's the logic behind it:

2.Validation: The calculator ensures your birthdate is valid and not in the future.

3.Age Calculation:

  • It calculates the difference between the current date and your birthdate.

  • Adjusts for negative days and months to ensure accuracy.

4.Display Result: Your age is displayed in a user-friendly format: Years, Months, and Days.
